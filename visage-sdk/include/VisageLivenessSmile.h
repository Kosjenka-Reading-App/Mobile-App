	/**
	* VisageLivenessSmile is a class that detects whether the person on the live video stream has smiled.
	* In order for action to be detected accurately, it is required that the face is frontal and facial expression is neutral for 30 frames
	* before performing smile.\n During smile verification, face data from latest 30 frames ("face data sequence"), i.e. last 30 calls of update() is used to verify head stability (STATE_WAIT_FOR_STABLE).
	* Each time the action is reset, face data sequence will be cleared and the action will need to go through initializing state (STATE_ACTION_INITIALIZING)
	* to store initial face data sequence.
	* Additionally, face data sequence is used as a baseline for neutral facial expression when detecting if smile was performed. 
	* Algorithm presumes that the face will be neutral before performing smile.
	* 
	* Action should be updated for each frame in order to update its internal state.
	* The action can be in one of the following states (states are sequentially verified in each call of update()):
	*	1. <b>STATE_WAIT_FOR_FRONTAL</b> Face is not frontal. Action is reset.
	*	2. <b>STATE_ACTION_INITIALIZING</b> Action is storing first set of face data sequence. After each reset, action needs to reinitialize.
	*	3. <b>STATE_WAIT_FOR_STABLE</b> Head is not stable. In order for action to be verified successfully, the user should keep his head still.
	*	4. <b>STATE_WAIT_FOR_ACTION</b> Data is processed in order to verify smile.
	*	5. <b>STATE_ACTION_VERIFIED</b> Action is verified.
	*	.
